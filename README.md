# Cursor Deepseek API Proxy

This project sets up a Docker Compose configuration for the Cursor Deepseek API Proxy, which was not originally provided in the [danilofalcao/cursor-deepseek](https://github.com/danilofalcao/cursor-deepseek) repository.

## How It Works

1. **Docker Compose Setup**: The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the service `cursor-deepseek` which builds the Docker image and runs the proxy.
2. **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file contains necessary environment variables such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and network configurations.
3. **Traefik Integration**: The service is integrated with Traefik for HTTPS routing and load balancing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your `.env` file with the required variables.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the service.

## Exposing the API in Cursor

To use this API in Cursor, you need to configure the URL generated by Traefik. The URL will be in the format `https://cursor-deepseek.yourdomain.com/v1`. Make sure to append `/v1` to the URL when configuring it in Cursor. Additionally, in Cursor, you should select `gpt-4o` as the model to ensure compatibility with the API.

## Acknowledgments

This setup is based on the original work from [danilofalcao/cursor-deepseek](https://github.com/danilofalcao/cursor-deepseek).
